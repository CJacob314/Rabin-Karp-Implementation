# My Rabin Karp Algorithm Implementation

I did this as a fun weekend project to try to:

1. Learn more about C++ patterns (like `std::variant` and `std::visit`)
2. If I were to ever try to create a file-compression algorithm, I would almost certainly need this.

### Implemented Based On
I based everything here on the following two Wikipedia pages (as well as the C++ reference available [here](https://en.cppreference.com/)):

1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm
2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin_fingerprint
